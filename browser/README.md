# Browser

## Watir

This is a framework that enables us to control and interact with a browser. Like most browser-controlling frameworks, it uses _Selenium_ under the hood.

## RSpec

RSpec isn't anything to do with browsers, it's used here to simply give us the `expect(...)` command in the final step oof the scenario.
